<strong> </strong><strong><u>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</u></strong>

Handwritten Digit classification using MNIST dataset. MNIST is a dataset of 60,000 training set images of  handwritten single digits between 0 and 9, each image is a 28×28 pixel square.

<strong>The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer </strong> <strong>values from 0 to 9, inclusively</strong>.

<ul>

 <li>Do Preprocessing step (Normalization). Rescale pixel values to the range [0-1].  Convert Datatype of pixels to float  Divide each image by 255.</li>

 <li>Build a 4 different architecture convolutional neural network model that can detect the digit of a given image. (change number of convolutional layer, pooling layers, …)</li>

 <li>Apply cross validation during training. The training dataset is shuffled prior to being split.</li>

 <li>Evaluate your models using accuracy.</li>

</ul>
